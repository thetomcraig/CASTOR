Creating new projects shouldn't be boring!  
Castor can create (or `cast`) new projects like a champ.  

## Features
* Castor can create a git-enabled starter project using one of the following schemas (or `molds`):  
  * Python
  * Bash/sh
  * Plain Text
* After making this project locally, Castor can push it to a remote location like GitHub
* For more detail see the [Molds](#molds) section

## Quick Start
* Castor has `molds` for each type of project.  
  * These can be viewed in the `molds` folder
* When you `cast` a new project, Castor will use one of these molds as a base
* Example: Python
